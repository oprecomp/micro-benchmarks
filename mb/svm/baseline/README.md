## What's new
- add scikit-learn interface, see [here](https://github.com/zeyiwen/thundersvm/tree/master/python)
- add quiet mode (-q)
- pre-built binaries and DLL for Windows x64 on CPUs are [avaliable](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shijiashuai/thundersvm/branch/master/artifacts)
## Overview
The mission of ThunderSVM is to help users easily and efficiently apply SVMs to solve problems. ThunderSVM exploits GPUs and multi-core CPUs to achieve high efficiency. Key features of ThunderSVM are as follows.
* Support all functionalities of LibSVM such as one-class SVMs, SVC, SVR and probabilistic SVMs.
* Use same command line options as LibSVM.
* Support Python, R and Matlab interfaces.

**Why accelerate SVMs**: A [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results) conducted by Kaggle in 2017 shows that 26% of the data mining and machine learning practitioners are users of SVMs.

## Getting Started
Supported Operating Systems: Linux, Windows and MacOS
### Prerequisites
* cmake 2.8 or above 
* gcc 4.8 or above for Linux and MacOS; Visual C++ for Windows

If you want to use GPUs, you also need to install CUDA.

* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 7.5 or above
### Download
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zeyiwen/thundersvm.git
```
### Build on Linux (build [instructions](http://thundersvm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started.html#installation) for MacOS and Windows)
##### ThunderSVM on GPUs
```bash
cd thundersvm
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j
```

##### ThunderSVM on CPUs
```bash
# in thundersvm root directory
git submodule init eigen && git submodule update
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DUSE_CUDA=OFF -DUSE_EIGEN=ON .. && make -j
```
If ```make -j``` doesn't work, please simply use ```make```. The number of CPU cores to use can be specified by the ```-o``` option (e.g., ```-o 10```), and refer to [Parameters](http://thundersvm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html) for more information.

### Quick Start
```bash
./bin/thundersvm-train -c 100 -g 0.5 ../dataset/test_dataset.txt
./bin/thundersvm-predict ../dataset/test_dataset.txt test_dataset.txt.model test_dataset.predict
```
You will see `Accuracy = 0.98` after successful running.
